# abT-gdT-cells-Team3
This is a repository for the current team that the students will work on &amp; submit.


Dear Team3, 

you can use this ReadMe file to construct your project, summarise ideas, and present results. 

The project guideline and requirements were kindly summarised by Alexander [here](https://github.com/maiwen-ch/2025_Data_Analysis_Topic_02_Gene_Regulation_of_Immune_Cells). Please read through this repo very carefully and start gathering your own ideas!

You will have to submit a Jupyter Notebook with your code & plotting/results, so make sure we can find it in this repository at the end. 

Also, do not forget to clean up this ReadMe and edit it, so that any external member of the course could read & comprehend what you did in your project. 

Good luck!
